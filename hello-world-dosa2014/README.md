Part A

This repository contains a simple Python code for "Hello world". Students are required to:

1. Clone the repository to their computer.
2. Change the file so that it says, "Hello <student's name>".
3. Commit changes to the local repository.
4. Push the changes to the remote repository.

Some commands that might be helpful:

Git Bash Commands (Basic)

For navigating around the file system:

mkdir <folder> -- Make a new folder called <folder> in the current folder. (Don’t include the <> symbols)
dir -- List the files and folders in the current folder. On a Mac, use ls
cd <folder> -- Change directory to <folder>. (Don’t include the <> symbols.) The folder must already exist.

Examples:
cd python
cd d:\python\finalProject
cd .. -- Change directory by closing the present folder and move up one “level” in the folder tree.

For using Git: 
git clone <link> -- Clone a repository from GitHub. Use the mouse to copy and paste the <link>. Once again, don’t include                         the <> symbols
git status -- Show the status of the current repository. Any newly created files will show up in red. Any newly                             added files will show up in green
git add . -- Add any newly created file to the local repository
git commit -m “<message>” -- Commit changes to the local repository with a message. You must always include a message
git push -- Push the changes in the local repository to the remote repository on Github.com
git pull -- Check that the local repository is up to date with the remote repository.
